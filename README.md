# Hengamers-HyperV-vagrant-setup-for-rhel8

### This is a quick setup for vagrant using HyperV as your provider
### i am using this for puppet and trying it out thus the names are put in like that
### feel free to copy this and change up the vagrantfile for your type of use this is more for my own storage of the vagrantfile :) 


## Guide

### make sure vagrant is installed and that HyperV is activated on windows, if you use any other virtualization program put in their names instead of Hyperv. 
### in the command line in the directory this vgarnt file is put into type simply "vagrant up" and youre good to go
